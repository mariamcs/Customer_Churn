# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction with XGBoost + SHAP

This project predicts churn using the Telco Customer dataset. XGBoost is used as the model, and SHAP is applied for interpretability.

This version is designed as a **basic starting point** for churn modeling. In upcoming phases, we will build **more complex, industry-specific models** tailored to real-world use cases in streaming (e.g., Netflix), fintech (e.g., Coinbase), and banking (e.g., PNC, JPMorgan), with deeper behavioral features, sequential data, and advanced interpretability.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Predict whether a customer will cancel their subscription based on their usage, contract type, payment method, and services used. While this is modeled on Telco data, it is broadly applicable to industries like streaming, banking, and fintech.

---

## 📊 Features Used (Basic Starter Model)

- Contract type  
- MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges  
- Tenure  
- InternetService, StreamingTV  
- Tech support, Online security  
- Payment method  

---

## 🔧 Tools

- XGBoost  
- SHAP  
- Scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn  

---

## 🧠 Key Insights from SHAP

- Long-term contracts reduce churn risk  
- Short tenure and high monthly charges increase churn  
- Not using online services (e.g., tech support) increases churn

## 🔍 Real-World Considerations for Churn Modeling

While this project uses the Telco dataset as a teaching example, real-world churn modeling is significantly more complex.

### 🔑 Example Feature Categories in Production:

#### Netflix / Subscription Services
- **What churn looks like**: Cancelling subscription  
- **Features**: Tenure, watch time, device types, payment history, streaming frequency  
- **Use**: Offer discounts, personalize content, optimize retention  

#### Coinbase / Fintech
- **What churn looks like**: Wallet inactivity, no trading  
- **Features**: Login frequency, trade count, funding method, fee sensitivity  
- **Use**: Send nudges, reward programs, fee waivers  

#### JPMorgan / PNC Bank (Consumer)
- **What churn looks like**: Account closure, fund outflow, product drop  
- **Features**: Product usage, digital login, balance trends, number of products  
- **Use**: Retention offers, cross-sell campaigns, digital engagement

### 🧠 Advanced Techniques Used in Production

- Time-decay features to detect declining activity  
- Latent embeddings for customer similarity  
- LSTM/Transformer-based sequential models  
- NLP from customer feedback and support transcripts  
- SHAP + fairness monitoring for compliance

## 💡 What's Next?

Future versions of this project will simulate real-world complexity by:
- Generating synthetic session-level data  
- Creating behavior-based features  
- Building real-time pipelines  
- Adding model interpretability dashboards

This project is a foundational step for broader applications in fintech, media, and consumer analytics.
